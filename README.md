# Save Our Sea
**Save our Sea** is a game for educational purposes. It aims to bring awareness toward marine pollution. In the original idea, we intend to provide some information in each run of game. 
This current version is the prototype of the idea. 

The game is built with unity on the basic idea of a 2D endless runner game.
